#Hotel Booking Analysis#
This Hotel Booking Analysis EDA project delves into the intricate world of booking cancellations and the underlying patterns. Its ultimate aim is to propose actionable measures that can help mitigate cancellations and secure revenue streams.

The dataset encompasses booking information for both a city hotel and a resort hotel, including details like booking timestamps, length of stays, and guest demographics. The project involves an exploration of fundamental EDA concepts and data visualization techniques.

In the course of this project, I will conduct an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis on the provided dataset, uncovering valuable insights and offering practical strategies to curb cancellations and bolster revenue. For instance, suggested strategies include incentivizing early bookings, extended stays through discounts, and enhancing the booking experience for direct reservations.

The EDA journey unfolds through three phases: data exploration, data preprocessing, and three distinct analytical approaches: Univariate Analysis, Bivariate Analysis, and Multivariate Analysis. These methods enable us to decipher trends, correlations, and patterns that reveal valuable insights.

In conclusion, this Hotel Booking Analysis EDA project underscores the pivotal role of data analysis in the hospitality industry. By meticulously examining hotel booking data and unraveling cancellation patterns, hotels can implement strategic measures to mitigate cancellations and enhance revenue streams.
